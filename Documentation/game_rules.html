<ol>
	<li>Players take turns placing single pieces on the game board.
	<li>Players may only place pieces in empty cells, or cells containing other pieces of their colour.
	<li>When a cell reaches "critical mass", it explodes immediately, emptying the cell.  Each adjacent cell has one piece added to it, and is converted to the same colour as the piece from the exploding cell.
	<li>A cell reaches "critical mass" when it contains at least one piece for each adjacent cell.  Therefore:
	<ul type=circle>
		<li>Corner cells explode when they have 2 or more pieces in them.
		<li>Edge cells explode when they have 3 or more pieces in them.
		<li>Centre cells explode when they have 4 or more pieces in them.
	</ul>
	<li>If an explosion causes other cells to reach "critical mass", those cells will explode simultaneously.
	<li>All explosions are resolved before the opposing player moves.
	<li>Play continues until one player has been eliminated.
</ol>
